### Conclusion
1. High Attrition Linked to Job Satisfaction: Employees who are “Satisfied” with their jobs surprisingly have the highest attrition (73), which might suggest underlying issues not captured by satisfaction ratings alone.
2. Poor Environment Satisfaction Drives Attrition: “Very dissatisfied” employees with their environment show the highest attrition (72), followed closely by “Satisfied” and “Very satisfied” ones, indicating potential discrepancies between stated satisfaction and actual experiences.
3. Moderate Job Involvement Has Highest Attrition: The majority of attrition (125) comes from employees with “Moderate” job involvement, possibly reflecting disengagement or misalignment with job roles.
4. Low Performance Ratings Correlate with High Attrition: Employees with low performance ratings (200) show significantly higher attrition than those rated high (37), emphasizing a strong link between performance and turnover.
5. Work-life Balance Issues Are Evident: Most attrition is from employees who rate their work-life as “Average” (127) and “Good” (58), suggesting room for improvement even among those with seemingly acceptable work-life conditions.
6. Relationship Satisfaction Impacts Retention: Those “Satisfied” and “Very Satisfied” in relationships with managers or colleagues still account for substantial attrition (71 and 64 respectively), indicating relational dynamics may need deeper evaluation.


### Recommendation
1. Investigate Underlying Causes of Attrition Among ‘Satisfied’ Employees:
   - Conduct qualitative surveys or exit interviews to explore why employees who report satisfaction still leave the company.

2. Enhance the Physical and Psychological Work Environment:
   - Improve office ergonomics, reduce noise, provide wellness programs, and address reported issues in environment satisfaction.

3. Develop Targeted Engagement Programs:
   - Focus on employees with “Moderate” involvement by offering growth opportunities, role clarity, and recognition programs to deepen engagement.

4. Address Performance Issues Through Training and Support:
   - Implement mentorship and development programs for low-performing employees rather than letting them attrite without intervention.

5. Reassess Work-Life Balance Policies:
   - Introduce flexible schedules, remote work options, and workload management to reduce stress and enhance overall balance.

6. Review Management and Team Relationship Practices:
   - Train managers on emotional intelligence, feedback delivery, and relationship-building to improve team cohesion and employee satisfaction.

7. Implement Predictive Analytics for Early Attrition Detection:
   - Use data models to flag high-risk employees based on their satisfaction, performance, and involvement scores for early intervention.

8. Increase Transparency and Communication Across All Levels:
   - Encourage open dialogue about job expectations, career paths, and organizational changes to build trust and reduce uncertainty-driven exits.
